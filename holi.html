Celebrants light bonfires, throw colorful powder called gulal, eat sweets, and dance to traditional folk music.

<p  id="p1">On the day of Holi, entire streets and towns are filled with people who throw colored powder in the air. Some fling
balloons filled with colored water from rooftops and others use squirt guns. For one day, it’s all fair game. Cries of
“Holi hai!” which means “It’s Holi!” can be heard on the streets. Holi has also been romanticized and popularized over
the decades in Bollywood films.</p>

symbolizes spring and rebirth. Red symbolizes marriage or fertility while both red and yellow — commonly used in ritual
and ceremony — symbolize auspiciousness.</p>
